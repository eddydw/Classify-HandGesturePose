        "Now imagine that you are a data scientist who needs to build a system that can automatically identify emotional states such as \"anger\" or \"joy\" that people express about your company's product on Twitter. In this chapter, we'll tackle this task using a variant of BERT called DistilBERT.footnote:[V. Sanh et al., [\"DistilBERT, a Distilled Version of BERT: Smaller, Faster, Cheaper and Lighter\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108), (2019).] The main advantage of this model is that it achieves comparable performance to BERT, while being significantly smaller and more efficient. This enables us to train a classifier in a few minutes, and if you want to train a larger BERT model you can simply change the checkpoint of the pretrained model. A _checkpoint_ corresponds to the set of weights that are loaded into a given transformer architecture.\n",

As shown in  <<hf-libraries>>, these libraries will allow us to quickly go from raw text to a fine-tuned model that can be used for inference on new tweets. So, in the spirit of Optimus Prime, let's dive in, \"transform, and roll out!\"footnote:[Optimus Prime is the leader of a race of robots in the popular Transformers franchise for children (and for those who are young at heart!).]"

        "Having a large vocabulary is a problem because it requires neural networks to have an enormous number of parameters. To illustrate this, suppose we have 1 million unique words and want to compress the 1-million-dimensional input vectors to 1-thousand-dimensional vectors in the first layer of our neural network. This is a standard step in most NLP architectures, and the resulting weight matrix of this first layer would contain 1 million $\\times$ 1 thousand = 1 billion weights. This is already comparable to the largest GPT-2 model,footnote:[GPT-2 is the successor of GPT, and it captivated the public's attention with its impressive ability to generate realistic text.
